# Mapping Earthquakes

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create interactive maps showing earthquake geoJSON data from the past 7 days. The data is collected from the USGS API and overlayed on map API's from Mapbox. The earthquakes points are represented in both size and color in relation to the magnitude, and can be shown in relation to tectonic plates through a toggle box. 

## Resources

- Data: [Earthquake GeoJSON](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson), [Major Earthquakes above 4.5 GeoJSON](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson), [Tectonic Plates GeoJSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json)
- Software: Visual Studio Code 1.67, Javascript ES6+, Leaflet 1.8.0
